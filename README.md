### Workflow
![Workflow](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aaf2db7f0930e69e7949c815b89844b781690d36f1c2d09173a2660b1bb604ba/68747470733a2f2f74686570726163746963616c6465762e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f692f676b33796b307532346b3538343966706c7979322e706e67).

Here is the project's workflow that must be strictly followed.

üí° For better visualization, it is recommended to use [Git Fork](https://git-fork.com/) or [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

### Branch Naming 
- Branch names should be in **snake_case**
- Use **name abbreviations** (first letter of first name + first letter of last name + last letter of last name). 
    - Example: Lauriane GELEBART --> LGT
- In creating branches, distinguish between functionalities: `feature/` for features and `bugFix/` for small corrections on development features. 

Examples: `feature/LGT_name_of_the_feature` or `bugFix/LGT_name_of_the_bugFix`

### Commit Naming 
- Commit names should follow the following: **action verb + short description**
  - Example: `add create terrain generation` or `update player movement script`

### Contribution Steps
- Pull the latest version of the project: `git pull`   ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Create a branch from the latest version: `git checkout -b feature/ABC_my_new_feature`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'add a new feature'`
  - üí° You can add co-authors with: `git commit -m "Regular commit message" -m "Co-authored-by: githubName <someemail@example.com>`
- Push your branch: `git push origin feature/ABC_my_new_feature`

If possible, use the **Rebase** feature to reduce the number of commits and only include pertinent ones.

üí° Note that all these actions can be performed on Git Fork or Git Kraken for better visualization.

## Naming in Code 

### Variables
- Use **camelCase** style for naming variables.
  - Examples: `playerHealth`, `itemCount`.

### Naming Constants
- Use **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** style for naming global or class constants.
  - Example: `const float GRAVITY = 9.8f;`.

### Methods
- Also use **camelCase** style for naming methods, ideally starting with an action verb.
  - Examples: `spawnObject()`, `updatePosition()`.

### Classes
- Use **PascalCase** style for naming classes.
  - Examples: `PlayerController`, `GameManager`.

### Utility Classes
- Utility classes contain static methods or constants shared across the application.
  - Examples: `MathUtils`, `AudioManager`.
